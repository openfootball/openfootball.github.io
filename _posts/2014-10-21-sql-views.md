title:  "`football.db` SQL Queries Made Easy (Thanks to Views) e.g. `select * from games_list;`"
---

First thanks to Joe Kampschmidt for getting started w/
some [SQL queries examples](http://openfootball.github.io/docs/sql-queries-intro.html).

Added some SQL views to make it easier to query the `football.db`.
Example - List World Cup Brazil 2014 Games: 

Before (Table Edition): 

~~~
SELECT t1.title, 
       t2.title, 
       g.* 
  FROM games g 
       LEFT OUTER JOIN teams t1 ON t1.id = g.team1_id 
       LEFT OUTER JOIN teams t2 ON t2.id = g.team2_id 
       INNER JOIN rounds r ON r.id = g.round_id 
       INNER JOIN events e ON e.id = r.event_id 
 WHERE e.key = 'world.2014' 
~~~

After (View Edition): 

~~~
SELECT * 
  FROM events_games_list 
 WHERE e.key = 'world.2014'; 
~~~

[More views](https://github.com/openfootball/schema.sql) include: 

- `teams_list` 
- `games_list` 
- `events_list` 
- `events_teams_list` 
- `events_games_list` 
- `events_rounds_list` 
- `events_groups_list`
